# DOSPDFtkSpliter

## What does this batch script do?

This DOS batch script uses PDFtk (https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) for Windows from the DOS commandline to split a multipage PDF file into separate files.

The original PDF file will remain in the directory after the script has finished processing.  

## How to use this batch script.

1. Place a copy of the .bat file in a directory that has a multipage PDF file that needs to be split.
2. Double click on the .bat file.

### It is recommended that this script be run on a set of copied .TIF images, not on "sole" copies. 

### This script assumes that the computer being used for implementation has PDFtk for Windows installed and that it is working at the commandline.
